It is classified as a \"microframework\" because it provides only the essential tools for web development, such as routing, request handling, and templating, allowing developers to choose and integrate additional components as needed.\n",

        "Minimalism and Flexibility:\n",

This flexibility is particularly beneficial for building custom APIs tailored to specific project requirements.\n",
